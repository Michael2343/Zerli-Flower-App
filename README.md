# Zerli-Flower-App

I developed a system with several friens called "Zerli" during my middle-year project in software engineering studies.
Zerli proggramed in Java with a GUI built using Scene Builder involves combining Java code with FXML files generated by Scene Builder.

## Summary 

The app will allow customers to browse the chain's product range, select a ready-made bouquet of flowers or a potted plant, or create a custom bouquet, and order delivery. The system includes a component called User Portal, which is an online interface through which system users can perform relevant operations.
