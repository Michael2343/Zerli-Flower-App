# Zerli-Flower-App
I developed a system with several friens called "Zerli" during my middle-year project in software engineering studies.
Zerli proggramed in Java with a GUI built using Scene Builder involves combining Java code with FXML files generated by Scene Builder.

## Summary 
The app will allow customers to browse the chain's product range, select a ready-made bouquet of flowers or a potted plant, or create a custom bouquet, and order delivery. The system includes a component called User Portal, which is an online interface through which system users can perform relevant operations.

## Explain on Files
### Docs
1. ToDoList Files: We created comprehensive ToDoLists with progress and management tasks for the beginning and middle stages of the project.
2. Visual Paradigm Files: We generated Use Case, Class, Sequence, and Activity diagrams using Visual Paradigm.
3. Package Diagrams: These diagrams depict the architecture of all project packages.

### Testing Zerli Project
We created several testing in progress to check our system
1. Acceptance Tests: Verify if the final system meets real-world user needs and business requirements.
2. Unit Testing: Ensure individual code components (functions, classes) work as intended in isolation.
3. Functional Testing: Confirm individual features and functionalities of the application function correctly according to specifications.
